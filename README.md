# Sublime Text 3 Plugins for Frontend Web Development

Sublime is great and for many still the best text editor available. But out of the box, it lacks some features that modern competitors have already built-in. Plugins help to stay ahead but it's a hassle to keep up with all of them. In order to help you, I compiled a list of plugins I use for my daily frontend web development.

If you know plugins that should be on this list, just open an issue. üòâ

This list was shared by (among others):
